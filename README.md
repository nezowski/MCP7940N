# MCP7940N
here is my program to write/read data from MCP7940N Real-Time Clock IC

even tho im not good at programming i decided to share code to this ic cuz i couldnt find much guides/info for beginners (besides very informative video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN56GDBot3Y that made me understand at least basics) and i thought that someone like me with 0 knowledge could use that program to learn about this ic. this code provides basic actions like: reading time, setting time, changing settings like coarse trim or backup supply enable, setting alarms and options related to them and reading power fail stamps.
